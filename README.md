The transaction fraud detection project aims to identify and prevent fraudulent activities in financial transactions. Utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms, the project analyzes transaction patterns to distinguish legitimate transactions from suspicious ones. Key features include real-time data processing, anomaly detection, and adaptive learning to improve accuracy over time. The system incorporates user behavior analytics, historical data, and various risk factors to provide a robust fraud detection mechanism. The project enhances security measures, reduces false positives, and protects both financial institutions and customers from potential fraud.
